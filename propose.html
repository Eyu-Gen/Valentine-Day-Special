                    I've been holding onto something for a while now, and I can't keep it to myself any longer.
                    Every time I'm around you, my heart races, and I feel a warmth I've never experienced before.
                    Your presence brings me a sense of joy and comfort that I can't explain.

                    I've come to realize that these feelings run deeper than mere admiration.
                    They're feelings of affection and admiration that I've developed for you over time.
                     I find myself thinking about you constantly, imagining what it would be like to share
                     moments together, to laugh, and to create memories.

                    I've never felt this way about anyone else before, and it's both exhilarating and scary.
                     Exhilarating because being around you makes me feel alive, and scary because
                     I fear the vulnerability that comes with confessing these emotions.
                     But I can't deny the truth anymore

                    You mean more to me than words can express. Your kindness, your laughter, your presence -
                    they all resonate with me on a level I never thought possible.
                    I want to take this chance to be honest with you and share the depth of my feelings.

                    So here I am, laying my heart bare before you. I don't know what the future holds,
                    but I do know that I want you to be a part of it.
                    Will you give us a chance to explore what could be?
